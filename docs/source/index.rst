UTK Datasets Data Models
========================

This document provides an overview for understanding how datasets are modeled at the University of Tennessee. The
document attempts to describe the technical parts that are important for migration and which are not. Unlike the other
content in the repository, the datasets are part of a Fedora 3.8.1 instance rather than Digital Commons.

If preferred, a more web accessible version of the document is available
`online <https://utk-dataset-data-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
